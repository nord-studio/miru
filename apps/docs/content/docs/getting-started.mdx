## Introduction

Miru is a free, open-source and fully customisable status page and monitoring service built with Rust and Next.js.
It was built to provide a simple and easy way to monitor your services like websites, APIs, dependency sites, and more.

Miru is designed to be local-first, meaning it can be run entirely on your own server in just a few minutes.

## Installation

There are multiple ways you can install and setup your own Miru instance. The cards below rank the installation methods from easiest to hardest.
