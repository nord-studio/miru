TLDR; Miru was created because I wanted a beautiful status page that was easy to use and looked beautiful without [shelling out $35/month](https://bsky.app/profile/me.tygr.dev/post/3ll5ucrwd4s2e).
The lack of self-hosted options that ticked all the boxes led me to create Miru.

## Why Miru?

Miru offers a simple, beautiful status page and monitoring service that is easy to use and set up. It is built with the following principles in mind:

-   **Simplicity**: Set up a status page in minutes, without any technical knowledge. The user interface is clean and intuitive, making it easy to navigate and find what you need.

-   **Flexibility**: Don't sacrifice your design for a status page. Miru offers a wide range of customisation options for your status pages, including custom domains, themes, and logos.

-   **Open Source**: Found a bug? Miru is and will always be [open source](https://github.com/nord-studio/miru) and free to use. We believe in the power of open source software and the benefits it brings to the community.
