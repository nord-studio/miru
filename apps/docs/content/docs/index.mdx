TLDR; Miru was created because I wanted a beautiful status page that was easy to use and looked beautiful without [shelling out $35/month](https://bsky.app/profile/me.tygr.dev/post/3ll5ucrwd4s2e).
The lack of self-hosted options that ticked all the boxes led me to create Miru.

## Why Miru?

Miru offers a simple, beautiful status page and monitoring service that is easy to use and set up. It is built with the following principles in mind:

-   **Simplicity**: Get started in minutes with sensible defaults and a clean, intuitive interface. Miru is designed to be easy to use for both technical and non-technical users.

-   **Flexability**: Each project, company and team is unique and has different needs. Miru is designed to be as flexible as possible, allowing you to mould your instance as it was already part of your stack.

-   **Transparency**: We believe in the power of open source software and the benefits it brings to the community. Found a bug or need a feature? [Open a PR](https://github.com/nord-studio/miru/issues/new) and help us make Miru better for everyone.
