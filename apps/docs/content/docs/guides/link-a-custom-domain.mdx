title: Link a Custom Domain
description: Learn how to link a custom domain to your Miru application.

## Introduction
In this guide, you'll learn how to link a custom domain to a deployed Miru instance. This guide assumes you have:

- A deployed Miru instance
- A domain
- A DNS provider

## Step 1: Setup a status page
Before we link a custom domain, you'll need to have at least one status page. You can learn how to do that [here](/docs/concepts/status-pages#creating-a-page).

Make sure you enable your status page, disable **Root Domain** and enter the domain you want to host the status page on under **Domain / URL**.

## Step 2: Configure DNS records
Once you have a status page setup, you'll need to point your domain to the Miru instance using an A record. Log in to your DNS provider and create an A record pointing towards the IP address of your Miru instance.

You can confirm that the record has been created by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
dig +short <domain>
```

## Step 3: Verify domain

Try navigating to your custom domain in your browser. If everything is set up correctly, you should see your status page:
