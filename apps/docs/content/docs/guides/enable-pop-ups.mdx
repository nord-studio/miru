## Introduction

When selecting rows in the status page table, you have the option to open multiple status pages in your browser, however, for this feature to work
properly, you need to enable popups for Miru. This guide will show you how you can do that for major browsers.

### Google Chrome or Chromium

1. In the left side of your URL bar, click the permission panel icon:
