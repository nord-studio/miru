## Introduction

One of Miru's main goals is to be as flexible and customizable as possible, we understand that each and every user has different needs and requirements, and we want to make sure that Miru can be configured to suit those needs.

This is where the configuration file comes in. The configuration file is a TOML file that contains all the settings for your Miru instance. This includes everything from toggling features, customising white labels, and everything inbetween.
