## What are Notifications?

Notification channels are a way to send alerts to external platforms like Discord and Slack when something requires action in your workspace.
These alerts can be triggered by various events, such as a monitor going down, a new report being created, or a new incident being created.

## Creating a Notification Channel

In order to create a notification channel, you need to have the `admin` role or higher in your workspace.

Head over to the admin panel and navigate to the **Notifications** section using the tabs on the navigation bar, from there you can click
**Create Channel** to start the process of setting up a new notification channel.

## Channel Types

Miru provides two types of Notification channels:

-   **Internal**: Used to send alerts to your workspace members. They will contain all information about the event, and links to the admin dashboard so your team can take action quickly.
-   **External**: Used to update your users in real-time in a platform they already use when something happens to a service they are using.

By default, Miru will send alerts via email to workspace members that have the `admin` role or higher, but sometimes this isn't enough and you'll want to be alerted in real-time in a platform your team is already using.

Optionally, you can create external channels that send alerts to your users when a service they use goes down, or when a new incident is created. This can keep your users informed as soon as possible in a way that is convenient for them.

## Channel Events

There are multiple types of events that can trigger a notification, they are either automatic (e.g. monitor downtime detected) or manual (e.g. a new incident is created via the admin panel).
You can find a list of all the events that can trigger a notification below.

### Auto Incidents

Auto Incidents are a feature that automatically create an incident when a monitor goes down. You can find out more in the [Auto Incidents](/docs/concepts/incidents#auto-incidents) section.
