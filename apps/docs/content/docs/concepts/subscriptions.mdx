## What are Subscriptions?

Subscriptions provide a way for your users to get notified via RSS or email when something happens to connected monitors on a status page.

This gives your users the ability to stay up to date with the status of your services without having to check the status page manually or access a platform that has an external [Notification Channel](/docs/concepts/notifications) setup
such as a community Discord server.
