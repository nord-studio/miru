## What are Workspaces?

Workspaces are a way to separate different projects, companies or teams within Miru.
Each workspace has its own set of monitors, incidents, status pages, notification channels, etc, allowing you to manage multiple projects or teams from a single Miru instance.

## Creating a Workspace

At the top of the navbar, next to the Miru logo, you'll see a dropdown with the name of the current workspace. Click on it to open the workspace switcher.
