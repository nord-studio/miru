title: Ping a Monitor
description: Use the API to ping a monitor in your workspace.
---

Pinging a monitor allows you to manually check if the monitor is accessable or not. The result of the ping is stored in the monitors ping history. If you want to test a monitor without storing the ping result, see [testing a monitor](/docs/api/monitors/test).

## Required Permissions

-   `monitors.read`

## Example Request

If the provided ID is valid, this request will return the details of the monitor.

```bash
curl -X GET "https://status.example.com/api/v1/monitor/pAbfD8udMmgzPdXx/ping" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Response

If the API key is valid, hasn't expired, and has the `monitors.read` permission, the API will return a JSON response with the details of the monitor.

```json
{
	"error": false,
	"message": "Monitor pinged successfully"
}
```

### Error Response

If there is a problem with the request, the API will return a JSON response with an error message.

```json
{
	"error": true,
	"message": "error sending request for url (http://tygr.dev/)"
}
```

## Types

The API will return a JSON response that can include the following values:
