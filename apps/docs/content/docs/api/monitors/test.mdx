curl -X GET "https://status.example.com/api/v1/monitor/pAbfD8udMmgzPdXx/test" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Response

If the API key is valid, hasn't expired, and has the `monitors.read` permission, the API will return a JSON response with the details of the monitor.

```json
{
	"error": false,
	"message": "Connection established with tygr.dev."
}
```

### Error Response

If there is a problem with the request, the API will return a JSON response with an error message.

{
	"error": true,
	"message": "Couldn't establish a connection to tygr.dev."
}
```
