## Required Permissions

-   `monitors.create`

## Example Request

This request will create a new monitor called `Website` that pings the URL `tygr.dev` using the `HTTP` protocol every 5 minutes.
Note that the monitoring service will ping using HTTPS first and then HTTP if HTTPS fails.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://status.example.com/api/v1/monitor" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
  "name": "Website",
  "type": "http",
  "url": "tygr.dev",
  "interval": 5
}'
```

### Response

If the API key is valid, hasn't expired, and has the `monitors.create` permission, the API will return a JSON response with the details of the created monitor.
