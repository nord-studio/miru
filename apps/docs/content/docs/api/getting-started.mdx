## Introduction

The Miru API is a RESTful service that allows you to interact with your workspace via HTTP requests. You can create an API with set permissions
as to not expose any sensitive data.

## Creating an API Key

To create an API key, navigate to **Settings** > **API** in the admin dashboard. Bare in mind that an API key can only access data inside the workspace, which means that
you need to create an API key for each workspace you want to access.

## Handling Errors

Miru's API uses standard HTTP status codes to provide context about the success of a failure. It also provides a JSON response with a `error` boolean that indicates
whether the request was successful or not. Since the API is still in development, sometimes the `error` field may not be present in the response so it's recommend checking the status code first.

## An example

Here's an example of how to use the API to fetch information about a monitor:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://status.example.com/api/monitor/<monitor_id>' -H "x-api-key: <api_key>"
```

If the API key is valid, hasn't expired and has the `monitor.read` permission, this will return a JSON response with the monitor's information.

```json
{
	"error": false,
	"monitor": {
		"id": "MAWVBk3M134tB5zX",
		"workspaceId": "oxf6K1uBV8VoIXVr",
		"name": "Website",
		"type": "http",
		"url": "nordstud.io",
		"interval": 5,
		"createdAt": "2025-05-11T19:42:06.009Z",
		"updatedAt": "2025-05-11T19:42:06.009Z"
	}
}
```

If the API key is invalid, expired or doesn't have the `monitor.read` permission, this will return a JSON response some an error message describing the issue.

```json
{
	"error": true,
	"message": "Invalid API key"
}
```
