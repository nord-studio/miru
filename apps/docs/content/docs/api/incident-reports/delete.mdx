## Required Permissions

-   `incidents.delete`

## A quick word

Miru allows you to edit or delete incident reports, however, it is extremely important to note that this should be done with caution. Editing or deleting reports can lead to confusion and misinformation, so it is recommended to only do so if absolutely necessary.

## Example Request

This request will delete an existing incident report.

```bash
curl \
  -X DELETE \
  "https://status.example.com/api/v1/incident/FnFjhojDxjoK1nWB/report/gdGKS29ZhFprMvvM" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Response

If the API key is valid, hasn't expired, and has the `incidents.delete` permission, the API will return a JSON response with the following structure:

```json
{
	"error": false,
	"message": "Incident report deleted successfully"
}
```

### Error Response

If there is a problem with the request, the API will return a JSON response with an error message.

{
