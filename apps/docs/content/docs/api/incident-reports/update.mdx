## Required Permissions

-   `incidents.update`

## A quick word

Miru allows you to edit or delete incident reports, however, it is extremely important to note that this should be done with caution. Editing or deleting reports can lead to confusion and misinformation, so it is recommended to only do so if absolutely necessary.

## Example Request

This request will update an existing incident report with the title `We have identified the issue and are currently working on a fix`.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://status.example.com/api/v1/incident/FnFjhojDxjoK1nWB/report/gdGKS29ZhFprMvvM" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
  "message": "We have identified the issue and are currently working on a fix.",
  "status": "identified"
}'
```

### Response

If the API key is valid, hasn't expired, and has the `incidents.update` permission, the API will return a JSON response with the details of the updated report.

```json
{
	"error": false,
	"report": {
		"id": "gdGKS29ZhFprMvvM",
		"incidentId": "FnFjhojDxjoK1nWB",
		"message": "We have found the issue and are working on a fix.",
		"status": "identified",
		"timestamp": "2025-05-18T00:52:02.478Z"
	}
}
```

### Error Response

If there is a problem with the request, the API will return a JSON response with an error message.

```json
{
	"error": true,
	"message": "Missing incidents permissions: update"
}
```
